          <h1>Fxteeyma </h1>
          <p1> In a world where fashion often leans towards fleeting trends, Fxteeyma stands as a symbol of empowerment and creative self-expression for Muslim women. My mission is deeply rooted in the desire to make <br> abayas accessible to all Muslim women, regardless of their sewing experience or financial constraints. </p1> <br> <br> 


          <p2> My mission is to teach Muslim women how to sew their own abayas, especially those who are complete beginners or cannot afford the soaring prices of modest clothing. I'm dedicated to making the art of abaya-making <br>  accessible to all, while honoring the rich traditions of Islamic modesty and identity.

            <strong> Why Sew Your Own Abaya?
